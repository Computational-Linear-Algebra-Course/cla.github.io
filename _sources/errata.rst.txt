Here we'll list all the updates to the exercises and coursework Classroom
repositories for Autumn 2020. An up to date version is in the
`public repository <https://github.com/comp-lin-alg/comp-lin-alg-course>`_.

#. Exercise 1.16. In the description of the exercise, it was intended
   that `C` should be stored in the upper triangular part of `\hat{A}`,
   but the lower triangular part was specified instead. This has been
   fixed now in the notes.
#. Exercise 2.3. There was an error in the parameterisation of the
   test, which is fixed in the public repository.
