Preliminaries
=============

In this preliminary section we revise a few key linear algebra
concepts that will be used in the rest of the course, emphasising
the column space of matrices.

Matrices, vectors and matrix-vector multiplication
--------------------------------------------------

We will consider the multiplication of a vector

   .. math::

      x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\
      x_2 \\
      \vdots \\
      x_n \\
      \end{pmatrix}, \quad x_i \in \mathbb{C}, \, i=1,2,\ldots,n,
      \mbox{ i.e. } x \in \mathbb{C}^n,

by a matrix

   .. math::

      A = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_{11} & a_{12} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\
      a_{21} & a_{22} & \ldots & a_{2n} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \ldots & a_{mn} \\
      \end{pmatrix},

i.e. `A\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}`. `A` has `m` rows and `n` columns
so that the product

   .. math::

      b = Ax

produces `b \in \mathbb{C}^m`, defined by

   .. math::

      b_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j, \, i=1,2,\ldots,m.

In this course it is important to
consider the general case where `m \neq n`, which has many applications
in data analysis, curve fitting etc. We will usually state generalities
in this course for vectors over the field `\mathbb{C}`, noting where things
specialise to `\mathbb{R}`.

We can quickly check that the map `x \to Ax` given by matrix
multiplication is a linear map from `\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^m`, since
it is straightforward to check from the definition that

   .. math::

      A(\alpha x + y) = \alpha Ax + Ay,

for all `x,y \in \mathbb{C}^n` and `\alpha\in \mathbb{C}`. (Exercise:
show this for yourself.)

It is very useful to interpret matrix-vector multiplication as a linear
combination of the columns of `A` with coefficients taken from the entries
of `x`. If we write `A` in terms of the columns,

   .. math::

      A = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 & a_2 & \ldots & a_n \\
      \end{pmatrix},

where

   .. math::

      a_i \in \mathbb{C}^m, \, i=1,2,\ldots,n,

then

   .. math::

      b = \sum_{j=1}^n x_j a_j,

i.e. a linear combination of the columns of `A` as described above.

We can extend this idea to matrix-matrix multiplication. Taking 
`A\in \mathbb{C}^{l\times m}`, `C\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}`,
`B\in \mathbb{C}^{l\times n}`, with `B=AC`, then the components of
`B` are given by

   .. math::

      b_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^m a_{ik}c_{kj}, \quad 1\leq i \leq l, \,
      1\leq j \leq n.

Writing `b_j \in \mathbb{C}^m` as the jth column of `B`, for `1\leq j \leq n`,
and `c_j` as the jth column of `C`,
we see that

   .. math::

      b_j = Ac_j.

This means that the jth column of `B` is the matrix-vector product of
`A` with the jth column of `C`. This kind of "column thinking" is very
useful in understanding computational linear algebra algorithms.

An important example is the outer product of two vectors, `u \in
\mathbb{C}^m` and `v \in \mathbb{C}^n`. Here it is useful to see these
vectors as matrices with one column, i.e. `u \in \mathbb{C}^{m\times
1}` and `v \in \mathbb{C}^{n\times 1}`. The outer product is `u v^T
\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}`. The columns of `v^T` are just single numbers
(i.e. vectors of length 1), so viewing this as a matrix multiplication
we see

   .. math::

      uv^T = \begin{pmatrix}
      uv_1 & uv_2 & \ldots & uv_n
      \end{pmatrix},

which means that all the columns of `uv^T` are multiples of `u`. We will
see in the next section that this matrix has rank 1.

Range, nullspace and rank
-------------------------

In this section we'll quickly rattle through some definitions and results.

.. proof:definition:: Range

   The range of `A`, `\mbox{range}(A)`, is the set of vectors that can
   be expressed as `Ax` for some `x`.



.. proof:theorem::

   Let `A \in \mathbb{C}^{m\times m}`. Then the following are equivalent.

   #. `A` has an inverse.
   #. rank`(A)=m`.
   #. range`(A)=\mathbb{C}^m`.
   #. null`(A)=\{0\}`.
   #. 0 is not an eigenvalue of `A`.
   #. 0 is not a singular value of `A`.
   #. The determinant `\det(A)\neq 0`.

A matrix can be seen as a change of basis
